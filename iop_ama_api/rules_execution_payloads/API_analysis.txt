Option 1: BAU Flow
    IOP posts updated fields and values to AMA
    AMA does the GET API call to retrieve full incident details

Option 2: New API
    IOP will POST fields that are changed + used by AMA for driving business process
    Changes are required on both IOP core and AMA side, 
        refractoring of logic is required as there is a change in field names 

Required Details:
    List of fields that are required for "Incident" consumers 
        - ex: who is consuming Incident details from AMA Kinesis stream
        - What fields are required to be posted to Kinesis stream
    Get estimates from SNOW & AMA for both  


    Follow same naming convention and domain model in all Incident interaction between IOP (SNOW), Event Stream, AMA and End Consumers

    consumer fields (10) + TTS bonding (10) + AMA business (10)
